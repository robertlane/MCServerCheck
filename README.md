MCServerCheck is a simple plugin that checks the status of you Minecraft Server.

== Description ==

MCServerCheck allows you to show the status of you Minecraft server to your target audience, with the option of setting it
as a widget or inserting elsewhere with shortcode.

To run your own Minecraft server I recommend [CraftBukkit](http://bukkit.org// "An Alternative Minecraft Server").

MCServerCheck is currently in alpha, and is not ready for deployment at this time.

Our current roadmap is as follows:

*   Allow the use of shortcodes and widgets to display information
*   The ability to pick and choose what information is displayed
*   Provide a basic style option for those who don't want to write CSS


== Installation ==

To manually install this plugin:

1. Upload `MCServerCheck` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
